# Trigger.dev examples

Welcome to @trigger.dev/examples, a collection of full projects using Trigger.dev.

## About Trigger.dev

Trigger.dev is a framework for creating long-running Jobs directly in your Next.js app with API integrations, webhooks, scheduling and delays. You can reliably run Jobs that wouldn’t normally work in serverless environments (like Vercel) because of timeouts.

## Purpose of this Repository

The @trigger.dev/examples repository demonstrates the capabilities and features of Trigger.dev through practical project examples you can fork and use.

For many more Job examples which are code only, check out our [Jobs Showcase repo](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/jobs-showcase).
